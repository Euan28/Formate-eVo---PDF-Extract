# Formate-eVo-PDF-Extract

Using Formate eVo to implement solutions to extract data from PDF files and store it in a more accessible, appealing and easier to view format

This project involved learning a completely new programming languague that is not widely known. Work was completed by reading the software manuals and improvising. The code in the project.txt file was used to extract specific data from PDF files from external company invoices. This code would be performed daily to allow various departments to see the exact data they required, without the hassle of searching for it.
